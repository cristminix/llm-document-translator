	<p class="block_11">In today's digital age, content writing is a vital skill for businesses, educators, and individuals, and using ChatGPT to write content can be a highly productive and time-saving tool. This chapter will delve into the practical application of producing an engaging blog post and provide step-by-step guidance on harnessing ChatGPT for your own content creation pipeline. You can also utilize these same techniques to create content for other mediums including newsletter content, podcast scripts, website content, social media copy, and so forth.</p>
	<p class="block_20"> </p>
	<p class="block_23">Step 1: Start a new chat</p>
	<p class="block_11">To avoid mixing topics and projects, it’s important to create a new chat each time you start a new task.</p>
	<p class="block_20"> </p>
	<p class="block_23">Step 2: Provide a briefing</p>
	<p class="block_11">Before writing the opening headline or the body section, it helps to warm up the model with some context and background information about your blog post. This could include information about the target audience, why you are writing the blog post, and what your goals are. By providing this information up front, ChatGPT can use this information as reference material for producing future outputs.</p>
	<p class="block_20"> </p>
	<p class="block_63"> Text Prompt</p>
	<p class="block_43">I want to write a blog post about looksmaxxing. I am writing this blog post on behalf of a male grooming company that specializes in shaving devices designed for men. My target audience is men aged between 15 and 40 years old who aren’t regular customers of male grooming products and lack knowledge about the importance of personal grooming.</p>
	<p class="block_20"> </p>
	<p class="block_11">After inputting this background information, ChatGPT may add a comment congratulating you on your intention to write a blog post on that topic or it might even start writing the blog content. Whatever the output, you can generally ignore it and proceed to Step 3.</p>
	<p class="block_39"> </p>
	<p class="block_40">Step 3: Choose your topic</p>
	<p class="block_11">Determine the subject of your blog post. Make sure it's specific and well-defined. If you need assistance defining a topic, you can ask for help by asking ChatGPT for suggestions. As a tip, it usually helps to request multiple suggestions (using a number in your prompt) to avoid ChatGPT responding with only one suggestion.</p>
	<p class="block_39"> </p>
	<p class="block_63"> Text Prompt</p>
	<p class="block_64">Generate 10 different blog topics about looksmaxxing</p>
	<p class="block_32"><img src="Images/image-19.png" alt="Image" class="calibre31" width="1572" height="1280"/></p>
	<p class="block_11">Using ChatGPT as an idea-generation tool, we can either select one of its suggestions or use these suggestions to design our own topic. For this example, let’s use option 10, which is “Looksmaxxing for the Busy Man” as this topic fits well with the product that we want to promote.</p>
	<p class="block_11">Also, if you’re wondering what <i class="calibre3">looksmaxxing</i> is, it’s a trending term used online that refers to the process of maximizing one's physical appearance through various methods including grooming, exercise, diet, skincare, fashion, and cosmetic procedures.</p>
	<p class="block_39"> </p>
	<p class="block_40">Step 4: Generate a headline</p>
	<p class="block_11">Now that we have chosen a topic, we can either adopt this topic as the title of the blog or we can task ChatGPT to explore some better options.</p>
	<p class="block_39"> </p>
	<p class="block_65"> <b class="calibre9">Text Prompt</b></p>
	<p class="block_43">Generate 10 headline alternatives for “Looksmaxxing for the Busy Man: Quick and Easy Grooming to Keep You Looking Sharp on the Go”</p>
	<p class="block_66"><img src="Images/image-20.png" alt="Image" class="calibre32" width="1562" height="1110"/></p>
	<p class="block_11">Of the 10 options provided by ChatGPT, I like option 8, but let’s stick with the original title as we want to position “Looksmaxxing” at the front of the title. Alternatively, we could go back and edit the text prompt by requesting that the title start with the word “Looksmaxxing”.</p>
	<p class="block_66"><img src="Images/image-21.png" alt="Image" class="calibre33" width="1438" height="1002"/></p>
	<p class="block_20"> </p>
	<p class="block_23">Step 5: Generate an outline</p>
	<p class="block_11">After selecting the title, let’s generate an outline for the blog. </p>
	<p class="block_20"> </p>
	<p class="block_63"> Text Prompt</p>
	<p class="block_43">Generate an outline for the blog (Looksmaxxing for the Busy Man: Quick and Easy Grooming to Keep You Looking Sharp on the Go) with 5 sections. One section of the blog should cover the importance of male grooming and mention the product “Super Shaver” for all-purpose male grooming.</p>
	<p class="block_20"> </p>
	<p class="block_11">It’s important to add the title of the blog so ChatGPT knows which title you decided to use. You can also add specific keywords or products that you want to include in the blog within your text prompt.</p>
	<p class="block_32"><img src="Images/image-22.png" alt="A screenshot of a cell phone  Description automatically generated" class="calibre34" width="708" height="776"/></p>
	<p class="block_11">Next, review the generated outline and refine it to suit your needs. This might include removing sections or switching up the sequence. You can do this manually by copying and pasting ChatGPT’s outline into a Word document and editing it there before pasting the updated blog outline back into the chat. Alternatively, you can try to use text prompts to edit the outline within ChatGPT. This approach works well if you only have one or two adjustments to make. If the outline needs major surgery, then it might be more convenient to edit the outline using an external text editor. Just remember to send the updated outline back to ChatGPT before you proceed to the next step!</p>
	<p class="block_39"> </p>
	<p class="block_40">Step 6: Write the blog</p>
	<p class="block_11">Using the chosen outline, we can now start to write the blog. Here, we can either task ChatGPT to generate sections of the blog across multiple chat messages or we can try to write the full blog post using a single text prompt.</p>
	<p class="block_11">Also, don’t forget to add modifiers to the prompt such as the style, tone, preferred spelling, target keywords, etc. </p>
	<p class="block_11">In this example, we’ll ask ChatGPT to mimic the writing style of James Clear, the author of <i class="calibre3">Atomic Habits: An Easy &amp; Proven Way to Build Good Habits &amp; Break Bad Ones</i>, using U.S. spelling.</p>
	<p class="block_67"> </p>
	<p class="block_63"> Text Prompt</p>
	<p class="block_43">Write the entire blog post based on the outline above in the style of James Clear using U.S. English</p>
	<p class="block_39"> </p>
	<p class="block_11">If you’re not satisfied with the output, you can try using the “<b class="calibre9">Regenerate response”</b> button (located below the output) multiple times until you get an output that suits your needs. If this fails, you may need to go back and refine your original text prompt by clicking on the edit button on the right-hand side of the text prompt.</p>
	<p class="block_20"> </p>
	<p class="block_32"><img src="Images/image-23.png" alt="Image" class="calibre35" width="1182" height="90"/></p>
	<p class="block_20"> </p>
	<p class="block_11">As a last resort, you can try breaking the task into smaller chunks by prompting ChatGPT to write the blog section by section, starting with the introduction and finishing with the conclusion.</p>
	<p class="block_20"> </p>
	<p class="block_63"> Text Prompt</p>
	<p class="block_43">Write the introduction of the blog post by expanding on the outline points above in the style of James Clear using U.S. English.</p>
	<p class="block_20"> </p>
	<p class="block_23">Step 7: Review and edit the content</p>
	<p class="block_11">As you receive content for each section or for the full blog post, make sure that you review and edit it to ensure accuracy, clarity, and consistency. Check for grammatical errors, inconsistencies, and factual accuracy. Make any necessary edits to ensure that the content flows and is engaging to readers. You might also like to use a third-party software such as Grammarly.com to check for errors and make other adjustments.</p>
	<p class="block_11">In general, ChatGPT excels at spelling and grammar compared to a human writer. Instead, most of your time will be spent on fact-checking any statistics or claims mentioned in the content and checking that the content is relevant and on point.</p>
	<p class="block_11">If you are unhappy with individual sentences, you can copy and paste the sentence and request ChatGPT to re-write or optimize the entire sentence.</p>
	<p class="block_39"> </p>
	<p class="block_68"><span class="text_15"> </span><span class="text_19">Text Prompt</span></p>
	<p class="block_43">optimize: But for the modern man, looking sharp and well-groomed is not only essential for making great first impressions; it also boosts self-confidence and contributes to overall well-being.</p>
	<p class="block_32"><img src="Images/image-24.png" alt="Image" class="calibre36" width="1452" height="528"/></p>
	<p class="block_69">Step 8: Optional extras</p>
	<p class="block_70">In the space of 10 minutes or so, you should have a convincing blog post ready for publication. Before you click publish, you may like to ask ChatGPT to draft the metadata title and description for SEO purposes or a social media shout-out for a social channel such as LinkedIn or Facebook.</p>
	<p class="block_71"> </p>
	<p class="block_63"> Text Prompt</p>
	<p class="block_72">Write an SEO metadata description for the blog, optimized for Google</p>
	<p class="block_32"><img src="Images/image-25.png" alt="Graphical user interface, text, application, email  Description automatically generated" class="calibre37" width="1396" height="404"/></p>
	<p class="block_11">Lastly, given that the current version of ChatGPT was only trained on data available before 2022, the language model isn’t familiar with the latest social media and search engine optimization (SEO) strategies. To overcome this problem, you may need to manually train the model regarding new content writing strategies by inserting any relevant optimization rules into your text prompt.</p>
	<p class="block_67"> </p>
	<p class="block_40">A Word of Warning</p>
	<p class="block_18">While there’s an obvious temptation to write an entire book, college essay, or blog post using ChatGPT, it’s important to use this software in combination with your own writing and editing decisions. OpenAI is said to be developing cryptographic technology that can detect a signature in the words produced by OpenAI’s text-generating AI models.</p>
	<p class="block_11">Amazon, Google, and other platforms are also wary of the impact that AI-generated content will have on the user experience for customers. As a result, <span class="text_20">they are likely to develop in-house tools to detect AI-generated content</span>. This is not to say that Google will penalize you for using ChatGPT to write the conclusion of your blog or that Amazon will prevent the use of AI writing tools in the production of self-published books. However, it’s likely that major platforms will impose a minimum requirement, mandating that a certain proportion of the content is original and not generated by AI. </p>
	<p class="block_11">To check the originality of the content, you can use online <span class="text_20">services such as </span>Originality.ai and <span class="text_8">Detect GPT which</span> offer software tools for detecting AI-generated content and plagiarism.</p>
