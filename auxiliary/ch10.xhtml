<p class="credit">PROJECT: SEQUENCE FROM A MUSIC VIDEO</p>
<p class="caption">Most shots require some degree of color correction and color grading. With Adobe After Effects, you can easily remove color casts, brighten images, and change the mood of a clip.</p>
<h3 id="ch10lev1sec1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_242"/>Getting started</h3>
<p class="noindent">As the term implies, color correction is a way of altering or adapting the color of a captured image. Strictly speaking, <em>color correction</em> is the act of adjusting the color in a shot to correct errors in white balance and exposure, and to ensure color consistency from one shot to another. However, you can use the same color-correction tools and techniques to perform <em>color grading</em>, which is the subjective manipulation of color to focus attention on a key element in a shot or to create a color palette for a specific visual look.</p>
<p class="noindent">In this lesson, you will correct the color of a video clip that was shot without the proper white-balance setting. First, you’ll combine two clips from a longer video of a young superhero taking off and flying through the sky. Then, you’ll apply a variety of color-correction effects to clean up and enhance the image. You’ll also use mask tracking and motion tracking to replace the sky with more dramatic clouds.</p>
<p class="noindent">First, you’ll preview the final movie and set up your project.</p>

<p class="title"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_244"/><span class="red">Previewing your project on a video monitor</span></p>
<p class="sb-noindent">If possible, perform color correction on a video monitor instead of a computer monitor. The gamma values between a computer monitor and a broadcast monitor vary greatly. What may look good on a computer screen may be too bright and washed out on a broadcast monitor. Always be sure your video or computer monitor is properly calibrated before performing color correction. For instructions on calibrating a computer monitor, see After Effects Help.</p>
<p class="sb-noindent">Mercury Transmit is a software interface that Adobe digital video applications use to send video frames to external video displays. Video device manufacturers AJA, Blackmagic Design, Bluefish444, and Matrox provide plug-ins that route the video frames from Mercury Transmit to their hardware. The same Mercury Transmit plug-ins work in Adobe Premiere Pro, Prelude, and After Effects. Mercury Transmit can also use monitors connected to your computer’s video card and FireWire-connected DV devices without an additional plug-in.</p>
<ol>
<li><p class="number">With a video monitor connected to your computer system, start After Effects.</p></li>
<li><p class="number">Choose Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Video Preview (Windows) or After Effects CC &gt; Preferences &gt; Video Preview (macOS). Then select Enable Mercury Transmit.</p></li>
<li><p class="number">Choose a device from the list. Devices with names such as AJA Kona 3G or Blackmagic Playback represent video devices connected to your computer. Adobe Monitor devices are the computer monitors connected to your video card. Adobe DV requires a DV device connected to a FireWire port on your computer.</p></li>
<li><p class="number">To change the options for your video device, click Setup next to its name. More options may be available in the device’s control panel or management application.</p></li>

<h3 id="ch10lev1sec2">Adjusting color balance with levels</h3>
<p class="noindent">After Effects provides several tools for color correction. Some may do the job with a single click, but understanding how to adjust colors manually gives you the greatest freedom to achieve the look you want. You’ll use the Levels effect to adjust the shadows, remove the blue cast, and make the image pop a little more. You’ll work on the clips individually, starting with the second clip.</p>
<ol>
<li><p class="number">Go to 4:00 in the time ruler.</p></li>
<li><p class="number">Click in an empty area of the Timeline panel to deselect the layers. Then, select the superkid_02.mov layer.</p></li>
<li><p class="number"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_246"/>Press Enter or Return, rename the layer <strong>Wide Shot</strong>, and then press Enter or Return to accept the new name.</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="image"><img src="Images/cc_05.jpg" alt="Image" width="660" height="175"/></div>
<ol start="4">
<li><p class="number">With the Wide Shot layer selected, choose Effect &gt; Color Correction &gt; Levels (Individual Controls).</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="noindent">The Levels (Individual Controls) effect may be a little intimidating at first, but it can give you great control over your shot. It remaps the range of input color or alpha channel levels onto a new range of output levels, functioning much the same as the Levels adjustment in Adobe Photoshop.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Images/cc_06.jpg" alt="Image" width="377" height="371"/></div>
<p class="noindent">The Channel menu specifies the channel to be modified, and the histogram shows the number of pixels with each luminance value in the image. When the selected channel is RGB, you can adjust the overall brightness and contrast of the image.</p>
<p class="noindent">To remove a color cast, you must first know which areas of the image are supposed to be gray (or white or black). In this shot, the driveway is gray, the shirt is white, and the shoes and goggles are black.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><p class="number"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_247"/>Open the Info panel. Then, move the cursor over the white frame of the garage door. As you move the cursor, the RGB values change in the Info panel.</p></li>

<p class="note-para">You may need to resize the Info panel to see the values.</p>
<hr/></div>
<p class="noindent">In one area of the garage door frame, the RGB values are R=186, G=218, B=239. To determine what the values should be, divide 255 (the highest possible RGB value) by the highest value in the sample. That gives you 255 divided by 239 (the blue value), or 1.08. To equalize the colors so that blue is no longer prominent, multiply 1.08 by the original red and green values (186 and 218, respectively). The new values (rounded) are 200 for red and 233 for green.</p>

<p class="note-para">For an even more accurate number, sample multiple areas of the image that are gray or white, average those values, and then use those numbers to determine the adjustments.</p>
<hr/></div>
<ol start="6">
<li><p class="number">In the Effect Controls panel, expand the Red and Green properties.</p></li>
<li><p class="number">For the Red Input White value, enter <strong>200</strong>; for the Green Input White value, enter <strong>233</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="image"><img src="Images/cc_08.jpg" alt="Image" width="709" height="397"/></div>
<p class="noindent">The blue cast is gone, and the image appears warmer.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_248"/>For each channel, the Input settings increase the value, while the Output settings decrease the value. For example, lowering the Red Input White value adds red to the highlights in the shot, and increasing the Red Output White value adds red to the shadows or dark areas in the shot.</p>
<p class="noindent">Performing the math lets you zero in on the appropriate settings quickly. If you prefer, you could experiment with the settings to find the best values for the footage you’re using.</p>

<h3 id="ch10lev1sec3">Adjusting color with the Lumetri Color effect</h3>
<p class="noindent">You used the Levels effect to adjust the color balance in the second clip. Now you’ll use the Lumetri Color effect to do the same for the first clip.</p>
<div class="note"><hr/>
<p class="note-title"><span class="middle"><img src="Images/note.jpg" alt="Image" width="15" height="14"/></span> Note</p>
<p class="note-para">The Lumetri Color effect in After Effects is similar to the color panel in Premiere Pro. To learn more about the Lumetri Color effect, search for “Color workflows” in After Effects Help.</p>
<hr/></div>
<p class="noindent">The Lumetri Color effect provides professional-quality grading and color correction tools that you can use to adjust color, contrast, light, and curves. You can apply simple color corrections or use more advanced color correction tools. The Lumetri Color effect in After Effects works the same as the color panel in Premiere Pro.</p>
<p class="noindent">The clip is in pretty good shape, but some fine-tuning will result in a better project.</p>

<h3 id="ch10lev1sec4"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_250"/>Replacing the background</h3>
<p class="noindent">These shots were taken on a clear day with few clouds. To add a little drama, you’ll key out the sky and replace it with storm clouds. You’ll start by using the rigid mask tracker to mask the sky, and then key out the sky color. Then you’ll replace it with another image.</p>
<h4 id="ch10lev2sec2">Using the mask tracker</h4>
<p class="noindent">The mask tracker transforms a mask so that it follows the motion of an object or objects in a movie. It’s similar to the face tracker you used in the Extra Credit project in <a href="ch09.xhtml#ch09">Lesson 9</a>. You can use it to mask a moving object so that you can apply a special effect to it, for example. In this case, you’ll use it to track the sky as it shifts in a handheld camera. There is a great deal of blue in this clip—in shadows, the cape, and other areas—so it would be difficult to key out the sky without first isolating it.</p>
<ol>
<li><p class="number">Go to 2:22—the last frame in the first clip before the transition begins.</p></li>
<li><p class="number">Select the Close Shot layer in the Timeline panel. Then select the Pen tool (<img src="Images/pen.jpg" alt="Image" width="17" height="18"/>) from the Tools panel.</p></li>
<li><p class="number">In the Composition panel, draw a mask that follows the roofline of the buildings. Complete the mask outside the image in the Composition panel, as shown below. It’s okay if the mask cuts off the boy’s head, because his head doesn’t contain blue and won’t be keyed out.</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="image"><img src="Images/cc_12.jpg" alt="Image" width="594" height="172"/></div>
<ol start="4">
<li><p class="number">With the Close Shot layer selected in the Timeline panel, press the M key to display the Mask properties.</p></li>
<li><p class="number">Choose None from the Mask Mode menu.</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="image"><img src="Images/cc_13.jpg" alt="Image" width="663" height="174"/></div>
<p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_251"/>Mask modes (blending modes for masks) control how masks within a layer interact with one another. By default, all masks are set to Add, which combines the transparency values of any masks that overlap on the same layer. While Add is chosen, areas outside the mask disappear. Choosing None from the Mask Mode menu reveals the entire clip in the Composition panel, not just the masked area, so it’s easier to edit.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><p class="number">Right-click or Control-click Mask 1, and choose Track Mask.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="noindent">After Effects opens the Tracker panel. The mask tracker does not alter the shape of the mask to follow a shape; the mask remains the same shape but the tracker can change its position, rotation, or scale based on the motion in the clip. You’ll use it to track the edges of the buildings without having to manually adjust and track the mask. Because the scene was shot without a tripod, you’ll track the position, scale, and rotation of the mask.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li><p class="number">In the Tracker panel, choose Position, Scale &amp; Rotation from the Method menu. Click the Track Selected Masks Backward button (<img src="Images/backward_button.jpg" alt="Image" width="13" height="11"/>) to begin tracking backward from 2:22.</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="image"><img src="Images/cc_14.jpg" alt="Image" width="591" height="170"/></div>
<ol start="8">
<li><p class="number">When the tracking is complete, manually preview the clip to see the mask. If it slips out of place, adjust the mask on individual frames. You can shift the entire mask or reposition individual points, but don’t delete any points, as that will change the mask for all the frames that follow.</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="note"><hr/>
<p class="note-title"><span class="middle"><img src="Images/note.jpg" alt="Image" width="15" height="14"/></span> Note</p>
<p class="note-para">If the mask requires adjustment on more than a few frames, delete it and draw the mask again.</p>

<h4 id="ch10lev2sec3"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_252"/>Keying out the sky with Keylight (1.2)</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now that you’ve masked the sky, you’ll key out the blue in the area that you masked. First, you’ll duplicate the layer, and then apply mask modes to isolate the mask.</p>
<ol>
<li><p class="number">Go to 2:02. Then, select the Close Shot layer, and choose Edit &gt; Duplicate.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="noindent">After Effects adds an identical layer, named Close Shot 2, above the Close Shot layer.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><p class="number">Select the Close Shot layer, and choose Subtract from its Mask Mode menu.</p></li>
<li><p class="number">Select the Close Shot 2 layer, press M to display its Mask properties, and choose Add from its Mask Mode menu.</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="image"><img src="Images/cc_22.jpg" alt="Image" width="662" height="177"/></div>
<p class="noindent">When you apply the Subtract mask mode, the influence of the mask is subtracted from the masks above it in the stacking order. The Add mask mode adds the mask to the masks above it. In this case, you’re ensuring that only the sky will be selected in the Close Shot 2 layer. If you zoom in to the Composition window while no layers are selected, you can see a faint line where the two layers intersect.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><p class="number">Select the Close Shot layer, and press the M key twice quickly to show all of the mask properties for the layer. Reduce the Mask Expansion value to <strong>–1.0</strong> pixel.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="noindent">The Mask Expansion setting determines how far, in pixels, from the mask path the influence of the mask on the alpha channel extends. You’ve shrunk the mask on the Close Shot layer so that the two masks don’t overlap.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><p class="number">Hide the properties for the Close Shot layer.</p></li>
<li><p class="number">Select the Close Shot 2 layer, and choose Effect &gt; Keying &gt; Keylight (1.2).</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="noindent">The Keylight 1.2 effect options appear in the Effect Controls panel.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li><p class="number"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_253"/>Select the eyedropper next to Screen Colour, and then sample an area of the sky near the boy’s head.</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="image"><img src="Images/cc_24.jpg" alt="Image" width="682" height="223"/></div>
<p class="noindent">Most of the sky is keyed out, but if your mask overlapped any of the shadowy areas of the buildings, they’re probably affected too. You’ll use Screen Balance to fix that.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li><p class="number">Change the Screen Balance to <strong>0</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="noindent">The buildings lighten up.</p>
<p class="noindent">Screen Balance determines how saturation is measured: With a balance of 1, saturation is measured against the smaller of the other two components in the color; with a balance of 0, it’s measured against the larger of the two; with a balance of 0.5, it’s measured from the average of the two. Generally speaking, blue screens work best with a balance around .95 and green screens with a balance around 0.5, but it varies depending on the colors in the image. For many clips, try setting the balance closer to 0, and then closer to 1, to see what works best.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li><p class="number">Click the Toggle Transparency Grid button (<img src="Images/toggle_transparency.jpg" alt="Image" width="20" height="14"/>) in the Composition panel to see the keyed-out area clearly.</p></li>
<li><p class="number">Expand the Screen Matte category in the Effect Controls panel, and then change the Clip White value to <strong>67</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="image"><img src="Images/cc_26.jpg" alt="Image" width="682" height="335"/></div>
<p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_254"/>The screen matte is the matte that remains when you’ve keyed out other parts of the image. Sometimes parts of the matte are accidentally keyed out. The Clip White value turns the gray (transparent) pixels to white (opaque).</p>
<p class="noindent">This process is very similar to adjusting Levels for a layer. Anything above the Clip White value is considered pure white. Likewise, the Clip Black value makes anything below the value completely black.</p>
<ol start="11">
<li><p class="number">Make sure Final Result is chosen in the View menu at the top of the Keylight (1.2) area in the Effect Controls panel.</p></li>

<h3 id="ch10lev1sec5"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_255"/>Color-correcting using Auto Levels</h3>
<p class="noindent">Although the storm clouds are dramatic, the contrast of the image and the color cast don’t really match the foreground elements. You’ll use the Auto Levels effect to correct that.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Auto Levels effect automatically sets highlights and shadows by defining the lightest and darkest pixels in each color channel as white and black, and then redistributing intermediate pixel values proportionately. Because Auto Levels adjusts each color channel individually, it may remove or introduce a color cast. In this case, with the default settings applied, Auto Levels removes the orange cast and balances the shot.</p>
<ol>
<li><p class="number">With the storm_clouds layer selected in the Timeline panel, choose Effect &gt; Color Correction &gt; Auto Levels.</p></li>
<li><p class="number">To brighten the clouds just a bit, change the White Clip value to <strong>1.00%</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="image"><img src="Images/cc_30.jpg" alt="Image" width="682" height="169"/></div>
<p class="noindent">The Black Clip and White Clip values determine how much of the shadows and highlights (respectively) are clipped to the new extreme shadow and highlight colors in the image. Setting the clipping values too high reduces detail in the shadows or highlights; 1% is as high as is typically recommended.</p>

<h3 id="ch10lev1sec6">Motion tracking the clouds</h3>
<p class="noindent">The clouds are in place, and they’re looking good. But if you scrub through the clip, you’ll notice that the clouds are static while the foreground moves due to camera motion. The clouds should travel with the foreground. You’ll use motion tracking to solve this problem.</p>
<p class="noindent">After Effects tracks motion by matching pixels from a selected area in a frame to pixels in each succeeding frame. Tracking points designate the areas to track.</p>

<h4 id="ch10lev2sec9">Using CC Toner to map colors</h4>
<p class="noindent">CC Toner is a color-mapping effect based on the luminance of the source layer. You can map two (duotone), three (tritone), or five (pentone) colors.

<p class="answer"><a id="ch10que1a" href="ch10.xhtml#ch10que1"><span class="red1"><strong>1</strong></span></a> Color correction is performed to correct errors in white balance and exposure or to ensure color consistency from one shot to another. Color grading is more subjective; its goals are to optimize the source material, to focus attention on a key element in the shot, or to create a color palette to match the visual look the director prefers.</p>
<p class="answer"><a id="ch10que2a" href="ch10.xhtml#ch10que2"><span class="red1"><strong>2</strong></span></a> There are multiple options in After Effects for keying out a background. In this lesson, you used Keylight (1.2) and the Color Range effect to key out the background so that you could replace it with another.</p>
<p class="answer"><a id="ch10que3a" href="ch10.xhtml#ch10que3"><span class="red1"><strong>3</strong></span></a> Use the mask tracker when you need to track a mask that does not change shape, but that does change position, scale, or rotation through a clip. For example, you can use it to track a person in an action shot, a wheel, or an area of the sky.</p>
